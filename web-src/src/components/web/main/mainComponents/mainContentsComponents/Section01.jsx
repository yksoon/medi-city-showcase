                        We would like to extend a warm invitation for everyone
                        to join us at "K-Aesthetic & ART Indonesia 2024".
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        K- Aesthetic& ART Indonesia 2024 is an official event
                        being organized for the first time in Jakarta, Indonesia
                        by Medi-City, a company based and headquartered in South
                        Korea.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Medi-City initiated the launch of the "K-Medi Platform"
                        in 2022 with the purpose of introducing globally
                        recognized medical technology
                        <br />
                        from South Korea to the world as well providing medical
                        educational content. <br />
                        In 2023, we established PT. MEDI CITY INDONESIA , with
                        the aim of serving as a medical business hub between
                        South Korea and Indonesia
                        <br />
                        which is the world's fourth most populous nation, having
                        recognized its almost limitless growth potential.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The first showcase, which will take place in January
                        2024, revolves around the theme:{" "}
                        <strong>"K-Aesthetic & ART 2024".</strong>
                        <br />
                        It will introduce South Korea's specialized plastic
                        surgery and beauty clinics to the people of Indonesia,
                        providing the opportunity for
                        <br />
                        direct consultation with customers aspiring to have
                        plastic surgery in South Korea. Influencers at the
                        forefront of global market trends will participate,
                        <br />
                        and it will be an invaluable time to engage with clients
                        with real needs.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This event is a collaboration with SUMMITS, which has
                        already been attracting Indonesian patients to South
                        Korean plastic surgery hospitals through the
                        <br />
                        "My Venus" Application service. Additionally, a Korean
                        art exhibition by ARTBUDDY will be held with the
                        intention of promoting K-ART. <br />
                        <br />
                        "K-Aesthetic & ART Indonesia 2024" is markedly different
                        from many previous K-Beauty Expos or Exhibitions that
                        mainly focused on hospital promotion
                        <br />
                        without significant foreign patient attraction.
                        "K-Aesthetic & ART Indonesia 2024" is distinct in that
                        it provides tangible results in patient attraction
                        on-site.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        We invite you to take the first step of your global
                        journey in 2024 with us. <br />
                        <br />
